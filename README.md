In this project we are supposed to create an application for College fest, as students want to take registrations for a Debate event and want to keep track of student details based on the course. Our task is to Help the students to create a table with the help of Spring, MVC, Hibernate ORM to perform CRUD operations on the table.
<br>
<H3>Sample Table:</H3>
Student_Id | FirstName | LastName | Course | Country 
<br>
1 | Suresh | Reddy | B.Tech | India 
<br>
2 | Murali | Mohan | B.Arch | Canada 
<br>
3 | Daniel | Denson | B.Tech | New Zealand 
<br>
4 | Tanya Gupta | B.Com | USA
<br>
<H3>TASK: Create a Dynamic web project and make sure that the following operations can be performed.</H3>
<ol>
<li>Insert new records into the table.</li>
<li>Update existing records into the table.</li>
<li>Delete existing records from the table.</li>
<li>Print all records from the table.</li>
<li>Add a security layer where there will be two roles USER, ADMIN.</li>
